# Trireme: Development Control Program for Deis

This is a stand-in project during development of Kubernetes/Deis. It may
or may not eventually become deisctl v2. But for now, it's a tool for
working with k8s.

## Why the name "Trireme"?

It's a joke. A really nerdy joke.

"Trireme" is a Latin word (like Deis) that is a corruption of a Greek
word. It refers to a ship that has three banks of oars. So...

- "Kubernetes" is the Greek name for a ship's captain...
- "Trireme" is the latin word for a Greek boat...
- And just like Deis needs about three nodes, a trireme has three banks
  of oars.

I warned you... it's a really nerdy joke.
